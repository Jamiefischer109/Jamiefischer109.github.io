# Welcome!
My name is Jamie Fischer and I am a junior at Lehigh University majoring in journalism and psychology. 

I am using this site to work with data sets, create graphics, and explore my interest in data journalism.

Please visit my [writing portfolio](https://jamiefischer109.wixsite.com/mysite) to see some of my past work.
