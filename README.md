# Welcome!
My name is Jamie Fischer and I am a junior at Lehigh University double majoring in journalism and psychology.

I have always loved writing, and have been part of The Brown and White's staff since my first semester at Lehigh. I was an associate news editor last year, and am so excited to be deputy investigative editor this fall. In addition to my work on Lehigh's newspaper, I have experience writing satire, sports articles, and lifestyle pieces. 

I am using this site to work with data sets, create graphics, and explore my interest in data journalism. As we discussed in class, data and statistics are crucial in establishing transparency. I am hopeful that using data sets will help make my stories even more compelling, and comprehensive, to audiences.

## Where do Lehigh undergraduates live during the semester?
Source: Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research and Strategic Analytics

This data was collected by Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research and Strategic Analytics. The [data](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf) details the break of up where undergraduate Lehigh students lived during the Fall 2019 semester. After viewing the data, we can conclude that the majority of students lived in residence halls, followed by off-campus housing. Around 13% live in Greek housing on the hill.

## Coffee Consumption by Age Group in the U.S.
Source: National Coffee Association 2020

This [data](https://www.perfectbrew.com/blog/coffee-statistics-infographic/) demonstrates the break down of which age groups in the U.S. drank the most coffee in 2020. To find this data, I first Googled the question "age groups that drink the most coffee, data table." I found an article with various coffee related charts and statistics, all posted by the National Coffee Association. Unfortunately, the National Coffee Association requires a membership fee in order to access the true data. The chart I found, however, included a concise summarization that was clear, reliable, and comprehensive. Although I couldn't dive into the research as much as I would have liked to, I was still able to draw conclusions and answer my initial question. Findings indicated that older adults drink the most coffee, followed by young adults in the 25-39 year old range. Older adults likely have been drinking coffee their whole lives, and rely on caffeine to get through the work day. It is very interesting to see that almost 50% of college students, who probably aren't employed in the workforce, are still avid coffee drinkers. I am curious if most young people drink it for taste or for energy. If energy, it is shocking that college students feel so tired that they rely on caffeine regularly.
