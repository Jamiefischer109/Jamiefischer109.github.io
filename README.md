# Welcome!
My name is Jamie Fischer and I am a junior at Lehigh University double majoring in journalism and psychology.

I have always loved writing, and have been part of The Brown and White's staff since my first semester at Lehigh. I was an associate news editor last year, and am so excited to be deputy investigative editor this fall. In addition to my work on Lehigh's newspaper, I have experience writing satire, sports articles, and lifestyle pieces. 

I am using this site to work with data sets, create graphics, and explore my interest in data journalism. As we discussed in class, data and statistics are crucial in establishing transparency. I am hopeful that using data sets will help make my stories even more compelling, and comprehensive, to audiences.
