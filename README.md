# Welcome!
My name is Jamie Fischer and I am a junior at Lehigh University double majoring in journalism and psychology.

I have always loved writing, and have been part of The Brown and White's staff since my first semester at Lehigh. I was an associate news editor last year, and am so excited to be deputy investigative editor this fall. In addition to my work on Lehigh's newspaper, I have experience writing satire, sports articles, and lifestyle pieces. 

I am using this site to work with data sets, create graphics, and explore my interest in data journalism. As we discussed in class, data and statistics are crucial in establishing transparency. I am hopeful that using data sets will help make my stories even more compelling, and comprehensive, to audiences. 

Please visit my [writing portfolio](https://jamiefischer109.wixsite.com/mysite) to see some of my past work, or my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-fischer-9633401a2/) to see my prior experience.

## Where do Lehigh undergraduates live during the semester?
Source: Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research and Strategic Analytics

This data was collected by Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research and Strategic Analytics. The [data](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf) details the break of up where undergraduate Lehigh students lived during the Fall 2019 semester. After viewing the data, we can conclude that the majority of students lived in residence halls, followed by off-campus housing. Around 13% live in Greek housing on the hill.

## Coffee Consumption by Age Group in the U.S.
Source: National Coffee Association 2020

This [data](https://www.perfectbrew.com/blog/coffee-statistics-infographic/) demonstrates the break down of which age groups in the U.S. drank the most coffee in 2020. To find this data, I first Googled the question "age groups that drink the most coffee, data table." I found an article with various coffee related charts and statistics, all posted by the National Coffee Association. To ensure the data was reliable, I researched the [National Coffee Association](https://www.ncausa.org/) to check that it was a reputable source. The site appeared to be both trustworthy and legitimate. Unfortunately, the National Coffee Association requires a membership fee in order to access the true data. The chart I found, however, included a concise summarization that was clear, reliable, and comprehensive. Although I couldn't dive into the research as much as I would have liked to, I was still able to draw conclusions and answer my initial question. Findings indicated that older adults drink the most coffee, followed by young adults in the 25-39 year old range. Older adults likely have been drinking coffee their whole lives, and rely on caffeine to get through the work day. It is very interesting to see that almost 50% of college students, who probably aren't employed in the workforce, are still avid coffee drinkers. I am curious if most young people drink it for taste or for energy. If for energy, it is shocking that college students feel so overworked that they rely on caffeine regularly.

### Top 10 States With Highest Minimum Wage - 2021
This is a bar chart created using Chartbuilder showing the top 10 states with the highest minimum wage in 2021. Minimum wage is a very pressing issue in today's society, and I was interested in learning about the various wage standards across the country. I Googled "2021 minimum wage by state," and sifted through various sources to find a comprehensive data set. Though the set I found included the minimum wage of all 50 states, I decided that the information would easiest to digest if I focused on the top 10. Original data can be accessed [here](https://www.opploans.com/oppu/articles/states-with-highest-minimum-wages/).

### Lehigh University College Enrollment Trends, 2017-2021
This time series chart was created using chartbuilder to show the Lehigh University enrollment trends for each college over a 5-year span, from 2017-2021. It is important for the university to understand academic demographics, as this can help them more effectively cater toward the growing student body's needs. The trends interestingly show a rapid rise in popularity for the arts and sciences, and a subtle decline in business majors. Engineering as remained more or less stagnant, with a slow increase. I am interested to know if these trends are more related to Lehigh's resources, or to the job market's demand for different expertise. The original data can be accessed [here](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2021.pdf)

### Self-reported Life Satisfaction vs GDP per capita, 2017
This scatter plot was created using chartbuilder to show the correlation between life satisfaction and per capita GDP for a variety of countries. The chart generally shows a positive correlation between per capital GDP and life satisfaction. This makes sense, as people in countries with more wealth would likely have a nicer home, a safer living situation, and increased food access. The original data can be accessed [here](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction).

### Correlation Between Mean Years of Schooling and Fertility Rate - 2010 
This scatter plot was created using chartbuilder to show the 2010 correlation between mean years of schooling and fertility rate in a variety of countries. In high school history class, we always analyzed these sort of global trends. I have developed an interest in population specifically, and was intrigued to learn more about how education and birth rate relate to one another. I Google searched this question, and found data [here](https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate).

The data shows a negative correlation between the two: more schooling is associated with lower fertility rates. We can attempt to draw inferences from this data. Using logic, I can potentially deduce that increased education about the use of contraception would lower the risk of accidental pregnancy, and lower fertility rates. Or maybe increased length of schooling increases individuals' desire to have a real career, encouraging them delay pregnancy. While I can speculate the root causes, howveer, it is important to note that correlation is not causation. While the positive correlation is significant, this trend does not necesarily mean that increased education CAUSES a decrease in fertility rate.

### 2021's Top 10 Happiest Cities in the World

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=13a2Am0srldlbMd1zo7V-noMD_EkSgByz" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

This map was created using Google My Maps, and shows the world's top 10 happiest cities as of May 2021 by location. This information is useful as it can both be used by tourists to plan trips and excursions, and can stimulate pride for citizens of these cities. It can also be interesting for cities and countries not featured in this top 10 to look at these results and see what they can do to improve the quality of life for their own residents. I find it fascinating that seven of the 10 happiest cities are located in Europe, the majority located nearby. I am curious why the majority are in such close proximity to each other, and  whether the increased happiness in this region is related more so to culture or geography. It seems as though many of these cities offer various tourist attractions and have beautiful natural scenery.

### Gender Identity, Campus Involvement and Party Safety

The following bar graphs, created using Tableau, demonstrate Lehigh University trends in party safety. The direct data was collected by the Lehigh Party Scene Survey, administered in 2016, and can be accessed [here](https://coursesite.lehigh.edu/pluginfile.php/4779926/course/section/3440491/Lehigh%20Party%20Scene%20Survey.pdf). 

The first chart shows the relationship between gender identity and whether or not a student has experienced "unsafe conditions" at an off-campus party. The graph shows that 20.85% of female students have experienced unsafe conditions, while 22.59% male students have. This surprised me, as I would have expected that female studnets would have experienced more unsafe situations than males. Even so, this result could be attributed to the fact that fraternity hazing is often more severe than sorority hazing. There is also a stigma that boys are "strong," so my internal bias could also be why I was surprised. 

The second chart shows the relationship between students' campus affiliation (Greek Life, Sports Team, Neither) and whether or not they have experienced unsafe conditions at an off-campus party. 29.01% of students involved in Greek life, 5.80% of students on sports teams, and 8.51% of disaffiliated students said they had experienced unsafe conditions. First of all, it's scary that these percentages are so high. I am also curious what would be considered an "unsafe condition," as I think the term seems a bit subjective. Evens so, the results didn't really surprise me. It is no secret that Greek life perpetuates intense drinking culture and a "work hard play hard" mentality, and increased alcohol consumption often leads to unsafe situations. Even so, the notable disparity between Greek Life's percentage and athletics' percentage did surprise me. I am curious if this is because athlete's parties have less alcohol involved, athletes party less in general, or if athletes are just more cautious as to not do anything that will hurt their season.

 ### World Happiness Index - 2019 Data Story 
 Made by Jamie Fischer 
 
Many of the prior visualizations I have created have centered around World Happiness Index, so I decided to keep the theme going with this week's interactive data story. A country's world happiness ranking is comprised on scores on several scales that evaluate how happy citizens perceive themselves to be, including perceived level of corruption, freedom to make life choices, GDP per capita, social suport, generosity, healthy life expectancy. Understanding this measurement is important, as it gives insight into what aspects humans value in terms of wellbeing. Much of the world data used in the index is collected from the Gallup World Poll. I found my data set on Kaggle, and the direct source can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-20152021?select=2019.csv).

My first map shows the relationship between a country's GDP per capita and level of social support. Bubble size corresponds to GDP per capita, and the color of each bubble refers to the level of social support. Viewers can also interact with the data and filter it specifically according to healthy life expectancy. Analyzing the data, I can conclude that countries with higher levels of social support tend to have higher GDP per capita, while countries with lower levels of social support tend to have lower GDP per capita. Overall, the blue, larger bubbles are seen representing affluent countries with better happiness rankings, while the red, smaller bubbles represent poorer countries with lower levels of perceived community. This indicates that there is a link between social wellness and financial prosperity. Perhaps when people are financially stable, they spend less time worrying about money and are able to spend more time forming supportive communities. 

My second visualization is a bar graph showing the overall 2019 happiness rankings, with #1 being the happiest country and #156 being the least happy. The bars are color coded according to level of healthy life expectancy. Based on my background knowledge, I noticed that most of the "happier" countries are affluent, smaller countries in Europe, while most countries at the other end of the spectrum are overpopulated, developing countries in Africa. It is likely that less populated countries have less competition for resources/money, which leads to an improved quality of life. I also noticed that happier countries tend to have higher healthy life expectancies than less happy countries. Higher life expectancy is associated with better access to medical care and improved physical health. Given that physical and mental health are positively correlated, it makes sense that higher life expectancy would be linked with higher levels of happiness. I also find it interesting that the United States is #19 on this list. Americans are egocentric and quick to think that they are "superior," so I was suprised to see that we are not even in the top 15.
